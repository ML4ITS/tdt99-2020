# TDT99 - Modern AI for Time Series Analysis (FALL 2020)

The course will focus on modern machine learning for the analysis of univariate and multivariate time series (i.e., anomaly detection, forecasting, classification, data imputation) with some focus on "irregular" time series. In particular:

- Use of FNN, LSTM and CNN for time series modelling and forecasting.
- Attention mechanism in LSTM-based architecture for time series forecasting.
- The problem of small data and low-data regime in the time series domain.
- Unsupervised and Self-Supervised Learning for different time series related tasks.
- Transfer Learning and Transformer architecture.
- Few-Shot Learning and TS Classification in low-data regime.
- GAN for time series analysis (i.e. Anomaly Detection, Data Imputation, Data Augmentation, Data Generation, Privacy).
- ((Deep) Echo State Network and Spiking Network for Time Series Analysis.)
